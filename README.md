# Investigate-The-Movies-Dataset

How can we measure a success of a movie ? 

It could be by different parameters like:

- The vote rate for the movie if it's highly rated like (8 or 9) in scale of 10 or very low rate like (4 or 5).
- The budget of the movie, mostly the movie with high budget has a bigger probability to succeed.
- The revenue of the movie ofcourse is a good indicator for the suceess of the movie.
- The popularity of the movie and how much propaganda it has.
- The genres or the type of the movie, maybe Action movies have the biggest revenues.
- The cast, the crew or the production companies could give us an impact about success this movie.
- So I'm going to digging into those questions, with data on the vote rate, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several films, and analyze it .....................
